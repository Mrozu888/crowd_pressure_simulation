class Agent:
    """
    Represents a pedestrian agent in the Social Force Model simulation.
    
    Each agent has physical properties (position, velocity, size) and behavioral
    characteristics (goal, desired speed) that govern their movement through
    the environment. The agent responds to social forces while navigating toward
    its target destination.
    
    Attributes:
        position (np.array): Current 2D position in simulation coordinates [x, y]
        velocity (np.array): Current 2D velocity vector [vx, vy], predkosc aktualna (po uwzglednieniu zewnetrznych sil)
        goal (np.array): Target position the agent is trying to reach [x, y]
        desired_speed (float): Preferred movement speed in simulation units/sec, czyli jego prędkość
        radius (float): Physical radius of the agent for collision detection
        active (bool): Whether the agent is still participating in simulation

        Initialize a new agent with specified properties.
        
        Args:
            position (tuple/list): Starting position as (x, y) coordinates
            goal (tuple/list): Target position as (x, y) coordinates  
            desired_speed (float): Preferred cruising speed in sim units/second
            radius (float, optional): Physical size for collision detection. 
                                    Defaults to 0.3 simulation units.
                                    
        Note:
            The radius of 0.3 units represents approximately 30cm for a typical
            pedestrian, assuming 1 simulation unit = 1 meter.

        Calculate the normalized direction vector toward the agent's goal.

            This represents the agent's intended movement direction without
            considering obstacles or other agents. The Social Force Model will
            combine this with other forces to determine actual movement.

        Update agent's state based on applied forces and time step.
        
        Implements Newtonian mechanics:

        - Position += Velocity × time

        Note:
            This method uses the Euler integration method which is simple
            but may accumulate numerical errors over time. More sophisticated
            integrators could be used for improved accuracy.
            
        Example:
            If an agent receives social forces from the environment, this method
            converts those forces into actual movement.
